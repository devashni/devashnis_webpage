                <div class="about-text">
                    <p>I'm a multi-disciplinary professional with a background in media and communications, an MBA in
                        Information Systems and Marketing, 3+ years of data analysis experience delivering actionable
                        insight to
                        consumer goods giants like The Clorox Company in CA and Danone in NY. Before transitioning to
                        data, I
                        founded an e-commerce store and worked for startups.</p>
                    <p>My non-linear career is the result of constant learning and looking for more challenging problems
                        to
                        solve and I've learned a lot along the way. Journalism taught me to ask questions, marketing
                        taught me
                        to explore different perspectives, and data analysis made thinking critically and analytically a
                        second
                        nature.</p>
                    <p>In 2020, I decided to learn Python, hoping to move to data science. My reasons to start coding
                        were similar to most people’s – to acquire a new skill set, to challenge myself and my learning
                        ability,
                        and potentially get a job in tech with good benefits, flexibility, and growth opportunities.
                        However,
                        from the moment I solved my first programming problem something clicked. I realized coding was
                        the
                        missing puzzle piece I'd been looking for in my career.</p>
                    <p>Since then, I've completed Hackbright's software engineering program for women built a full-stack
                        web-app
                        called Mockingbird (an algorithm visualizer), participated in hackathons and am really excited about finally having found
                        something
                        that I truly am passionate about and building a career in it.</p>

                    <p>The Mockingbird web app uses a Markov chain based text generation algorithm to generate random
                        believable sentences mimicking the style of the original author. The ‘source text’ can be pulled
                        from live tweets off Twitter for up to two different sources or selected from the app database.
                        Sentences based on one person’s tweets can be entertaining but throwing in interesting
                        personalities to the mix can produce compelling and often hilarious results.</p>
                    <p>Users can enable or disable visualization of the steps of the text generation algorithm, change
                        visualization speed, save generated text and create word clouds to analyze and compare
                        tweets/text (including emojis!) from multiple authors. Use it for fun or use it for education!
